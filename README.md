# Responsible-AI-Bias-Detection-Mitigation-System
* Developed and implemented a comprehensive bias detection system using Python, scikit-learn, and Fairlearn to identify gender discrimination in AI hiring models, achieving 96% bias reduction while maintaining 84% model accuracy
* Built end-to-end machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training with RandomForest, fairness metrics calculation (demographic parity, equalized odds), and algorithmic bias mitigation using ExponentiatedGradient and ThresholdOptimizer techniques
* Created interactive data visualizations and comparative analysis demonstrating measurable improvement in AI fairness metrics, translating complex technical concepts into business-relevant insights for stakeholder decision-making
